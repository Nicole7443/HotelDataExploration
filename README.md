## Topics/Concepts Covered in This Project
#### 1. Data Gathering and Cleaning
- Data wrangling and validation
- Storing gathered data from CSV to SQLite database
#### 2. Database Connectivity and Configurations
- Established connectivity between R Markdown in Rstudio to GitHub and SQLite for live data extraction, ingestion, and updates
- Established connectivty between SQLite database to Power BI tool via ODBC Driver
#### 3. Data Analysis
- Data assessed in three platforms: SQLite, RStudio, Power BI
- Perfomed univariate and bivariate exploration of data using `ggplot2` R package to explore trends and linear correlations
- Aggregated data in SQL for direct hotel comparison across 32 variables
- Developed 17 custom table views to prepare data for visualization on Power BI on critical variables
#### 4. Data Visualization
- Developed synced Power BI Report and Dashboard to highlight and findings from EDA process in Rstudio and SQL

The final project was placed into an R Markdown HTML file to enable the user to view the project on a website platform which includes a table of contents for the study.
